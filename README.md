# Foundations of Large Language Models Projects

This repository contains projects and experiments designed to implement and reinforce concepts from the book:

**Foundations of Large Language Models**  
*Authors: Tong Xiao & Jingbo Zhu*

The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on projects that help translate theoretical concepts into practical implementations. Each project aims to deepen understanding of the core principles behind large language models (LLMs), from their architectures to their training and application.
